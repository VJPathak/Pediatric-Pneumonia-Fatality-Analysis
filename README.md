Deaths in children due to Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. With pneumonia, pus and fluid fill the alveoli in one or both lungs, and this interferes with oxygen absorption, making breathing difficult.

Symptoms of pneumonia: Signs of pneumonia are a combination of respiratory symptoms, including 'cough and fast or difficult breathing due to a chest-related problem'.

Pneumonia stands to be the **biggest** reason for infant and child mortality around the world. 
- Infant mortality rate can be defined as the number of children less than 1 year old who die in any given year per 1000 live births.
- Child mortality rate is the probability of dying between exact age one and age five, expressed as the number of deaths of children from exact age one to less than age five during a given period per 1,000 children surviving to age 12 months at the beginning of the period.
